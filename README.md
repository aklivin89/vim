# vim
These are my current working files for configuring Vim as a Python IDE. These are my first baby steps working with Vim
so ther will be many updates as I learn the finer nuances of Vim.
Ultimately it will be configured to work as a ROS development environment for both Python and C++. I will also be adding 
ros.vim support along with many other goodies that I find suite my fancy along the way.
